# LicencePlate-Recognition
## 🚗🔍 License Plate Recognition System
A Python-based system that detects a vehicle’s license plate from an image and extracts the plate number using OCR.

## 🌟 Features
* 🔍 Automatic license plate detection using contour analysis

* 🧠 Optical Character Recognition using Tesseract

* 🖼️ Preprocessing pipeline — grayscale, blur, edge detection

* 📦 Simple, clean, and beginner-friendly code

* ⚡ Works on any clear vehicle image
